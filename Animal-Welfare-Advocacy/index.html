								This type of diet can help reduce the need of animals being used as human foods.
								It is said that reducing your animal products intake for one month can save 25kg 
								of meat or equivalent to 2-3 chickens. Therefore, as a person who cares for animals I decided 
								that I will only eat animal products 2-3 days a week which can contribute to 
								reducing the need of animals being killed for human foods.
